# Paige — PWS V0.8

An iPhone-friendly character chat app hosted on GitHub Pages. Paige is an adult massage therapist with a warm, quirky voice and a lightly flirtatious tone when welcomed.

## Features

- Chat with a short opening scene and Paige's portrait in the header and replies
- Regenerate and Continue controls, plus copy and text export
- Editable character prompt and optional user-written memory
- Conversation history saved locally in this browser
- Installable web app with an offline shell
- AI requests sent to a Cloudflare Worker, which holds the OpenAI API key as a server-side secret

## Live site

https://imalumberjacklikemydad.github.io/Paige/

The site and Worker are separate deployments. Publishing this repository updates the GitHub Pages frontend; it does not automatically replace the Worker running on Cloudflare.

## Privacy and deployment

Never put an OpenAI API key in frontend settings, JavaScript or this repository. Add it as the `OPENAI_API_KEY` secret in Cloudflare. Chat history and memory live in this browser's local storage; changing devices or clearing site data may remove them. Export a conversation before clearing browser data.

The Worker endpoint is reachable from the public site and should be treated as a private prototype. Origin checks alone do not authenticate callers or cap API spending; add appropriate access and usage limits before inviting others to use it.

## Current behaviour

Paige's default prompt is tuned for natural conversation, understated flirtation and careful scene awareness: she should respond to spoken dialogue and observable actions, not private narration in visitor messages. Existing untouched default prompts are migrated automatically. A prompt you edited yourself remains yours. The frontend sends the conversation context and character instructions in the `message` field expected by the currently deployed Worker.
